Highchair Remote
----------------
As of Google App Engine SDK version 1.4.3, it is possible to interface
with App Engine services from any application through the
[Remote API library][gae_remote].

    val remote = Remote("localhost" -> 8080, "user@foo.com" -> "foopass")

With a ``Remote`` instance, you can interact with various App Engine services.

    remote {
      val ds = DatastoreServiceFactory.getDatastoreService
      ds.put(new Entity("RemoteEntity"))
    }

``Remote``s allow you to scope remote calls such that when the block
terminates, subsequent service calls will resume local bindings. Because
it's a [loaner](http://scala.sygneca.com/patterns/loan), you don't need to worry about failures wreaking havoc;
cleanup happens automatically in all scenarios.

Calls to ``remote`` result in an ``Either[Throwable, A]``, where ``A`` is
the result type of the block. This allows you to sanely retrieve results
(if you want them) on success, as well as deal with any failures.

Highchair Util and Spec
--------------
The util module provides a single useful tool, `DevServer`, which provides
basic control over a local GAE dev server. If you have defined the
`APPENGINE_SDK_HOME` environment variable, the following is enough to obtain
a `DevServer` instance:

    val server = DevServer()

With a `DevServer`, you can quickly start and deploy an app:

    server.start(pathToWar)
    
The spec module contains a new base spec for integration tests against a
local app:

    class MyGAESpec extends AppStoreSpec(pathToWar) { /* specs here */ }

Breaking Changes
----------------
* ``Kind#newKey`` has been removed as it relied on a hack that fails locally in current versions of the sdk
