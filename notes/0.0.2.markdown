Queries
-------
Queries are now represented by ``Query`` instances. ``Kind#find`` now receives
a ``Query`` instance instead of a vararg list of filters. Filters are added
to a query by the and (``&&``) operation.
    
    Person find {
      Person.firstName === "Chris" && Person.lastName === "Lewis"
    }
    
Implicit conversions exist for converting properties to property filters as well
as property filters to queries, so the following query works as expected:
    
    Person find { Person.lastName === "Lewis" }
    
Features

* ``&&`` operations for a more natural query syntax
