Simple Persistence for Scala in Google App Engine
-------------------------------------------------
It is possible to use JPA, JDO, or even the low-level API to handle persistence to Google App Engine's Datastore from scala.
However, none of these are nice to use, especially from scala (xml + annotations + java collections = blah). [Highchair][hc] aims
to provide an idiomatic and natural API for persisting scala objects to the datastore.

This is a young library, so feedback is most welcome. [Highchair][hc] is currently in use in the reference application [lssn.me][lssn],
a minimal URL shortner deployed to Google App Engine ([source][lssn-src]).

Features
--------
* Type-safe query DSL.
* Focus on immutability. Entity => object instantiation is done via constructors, so case classes are a natrual choice.
* Easy to setup and use. 
* Test harness to run data bound tests via [specs][specs].
