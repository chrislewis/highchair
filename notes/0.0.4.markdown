New Query DSL
-------------
Version 0.0.4 introduces a new query DSL which intentionally resembles the excellent
[rogue DSL][rogue]. The DSL has always been type-safe, but the new DSL more closely
resembles the structure of a query while enabling you to store queries (or base
queries) for reuse. Queries now look like this:

    Person where (_.name is "Martin")
      and (_.lastName in ("Odersky", "Jones"))
      orderDesc (_.age)

New Features in Datastore
-------------------------
* New query DSL based on the excellent [rogue DSL][rogue]
* Support for mapping Joda ``DateTime`` and Google ``BlobKey`` properties
* Query support for limits, offsets, and efficient keys-only queries
* ``Connection`` object as a convenience for implicit ``DatastoreService`` instances
   
Breaking Changes
----------------
Now that highchair is no longer focused only on the datastore, packages have been
restructured to better support multiple modules. This means prior code won't work.
If you are using highchair and such changes have troublesome effects on your project,
bug me on [the list][group] and I'll be inclined to listen.
